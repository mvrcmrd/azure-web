				<h2>Instructions</h2>
				<p>Instructions for this game:</p>
				<p>The object of the game is to get the highest score by rolling five dices. 
				Each player will roll the dice three times to try to get one of thirteen possible combinations.</p>
				<p>This application implements a simplified game with only onw player.</p>
				<p>5 dices
				<p>A score card</p>
				<p>Starting and developing the game:</p>
				<p>The player takes a score card.</p>
				He can roll all five dices up to three times. 
				At this point you can write down your score or put aside the dice you want, 
				which may be different from the ones you chose for the first time. 
				If you wish, you can roll the dice for the third time. 
				After the third shot you must decide which score you will score in any of the boxes. 
				If you have no available moves you must score a zero.

				End of the game
				The game ends when the player have filled the thirteen squares with some score, 
				which can be zero. At this moment the points are added. 
				If you get more than 63 points in the Top Section you add 35 bonus points. 
				You must remember to add up all the bonus points for additional Yahtzee in the Lower Section.
				The player who gets the highest score by adding the points of the Upper Section 
				and the Lower Section wins the game. 

				Combinations and scoring
				The combinations are divided into two sections: Upper and Lower.

				In the Upper Section you will record scores for combinations of a single number 
				of points on the die. You must try to get as many equal dice so that you get a higher score.
				The score that you will write down will be the sum of the points of the one you are looking for.
				For example, if you get three dice out of five, you are going to multiply 
				three by five which equals fifteen and that is your score. 
				If the sum of your points in this section is greater than 63, you will get a bonus of 35 points.

				In the Lower Section the possible combinations are more varied and include:

				3 of a kind: You must get three of the same dice. You add up the score of all the dice.
				4 of a kind: You must get four of the same dice. You add up the score of all the dice.
				Full House: You must get three dice from one class and two from another. 
				This play is worth 25 points.
				Small Straight: You must get four consecutive dice. This play is worth 30 points.
				Large Straight: You must get five consecutive dice. This play is worth 40 points.
				Yahtzee: You must get five identical dice of the same class. This play is worth 50 points.
				Chance: Here you can write down any play you get. 
				The score will be the sum of all the dice. 
				It is a play that allows you not to miss the shot when you have no other scoring option available.
				Yahtzee Bonuses: If in the same game you get more than one Yahtzee, 
				and you had marked 50 in the Yahtzee box, you will get a 100 points bonus.
				You must place a mark for each additional Yahtzee and take a bonus token. 
				If you had scored zero on the Yahtzee you don't get the bonus but you can use 
				the wild card rule (see below).
